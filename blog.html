            </p>

            <p class="ans-blog">Ans: <b>Local Storage</b> is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or
                manually. <br>
                <b>Session Storage</b> is session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only
                for
                the duration of a session, until the browser (or tab) is closed.

            <p class="ques-blog">2. What are the differences between <b>Global Scope</b> and <b>Block Scope</b>?</p>

            <p class="ans-blog">Ans: The<b>Global Scope</b> is the scope that contains, and is visible in, all other
                scopes.
                In client-side JavaScript, the global scope is
                generally the web page inside which all the code is being executed. <br>

                <b>Block Scope</b> restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the
                outside of the block.

            <p class="ques-blog">3. How <b>Event Loop</b> works in JavaScript?</p>

            <p class="ans-blog">Ans: <b>Event Loop</b> is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing
                events, and executing queued sub-tasks.
